# Zerynth Embedded Coding Challenge 1

The challenge consists in solving the coding exercises in the folders of this repository. 
They are designed to test embedded C knowledge and programming in general. 
It is not necessary for the code to compile: clear comments are more appreciated than no missing semicolon. 
The solution quality will be evaluated on the logical correctness of the implementation.


Exercises list:

1. A ring to buffer them all
2. Under the heap
3. Hashes to hashes
4. Nasal demons
